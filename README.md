# ComposePPT

An experimental UI toolkit for creating PowerPoint presentations using Compose. Inspired by [Glance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/glance) and [Mosaic](https://github.com/JakeWharton/mosaic).

## Why?

This project is created just for fun and demonstrate the power of Compose Runtime ðŸ’ª.

## Download 
First, add the composePPT dependency from maven central. You should also add the compose compiler to kotlin compiler classpath.

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.fatihgiris.composePPT:composePPT:0.1.0")
    
    // Add the compose compiler to kotlin compiler classpath
    add(
        org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.PLUGIN_CLASSPATH_CONFIGURATION_NAME, 
        "org.jetbrains.compose.compiler:compiler:1.1.1" // Compatible with Kotlin 1.6.10
    ) 
}
```
## Usage

There is a single entry point called `runComposePPT` to create a presentation. 
In order to add a content, you must use `Slide` composable to add slides to a presentation first. 
Then you can place the composables inside the `Slide` composable. 

```kotlin
fun main() {
    runComposePPT {
        // Slide composable must be used to place other composables 
        Slide {
            Text("Hello from composePPT")
        }
    }
}
```

After running the above code, you will see a presentation file `composePPT.pptx` in your project root folder.
You can modify the presentation file name as below.

```kotlin
runComposePPT(presentationFileName = "myPresentation") { ... }
```

Calling `runComposePPT` several times is allowed if you want to create all presentations at once.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    runComposePPT(presentationFileName = "firstPresentation") { ... }
    runComposePPT(presentationFileName = "secondPresentation") { ... }
}
```

You can also use [side effects](#side-effects) and [`remember`](#state-in-composeppt) composable function. 

## Composables 

### `Slide` 
A slide element which is to be used to place the content. 

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        Text(
            text = "ComposePPT is a UI toolkit to create PowerPoint " +
                    "presentations with Compose ðŸ¤©"
        )
    }
}
```

The above code will generate a slide without a title. If you want to have title, you can use `title` attribute.

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide(title = "ComposePPT") {
        Text(
            text = "ComposePPT is a UI toolkit to create PowerPoint " +
                    "presentations with Compose ðŸ¤©"
        )
    }
}
```

Additionally, you can create multiple slides as below.

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        Text(text = "First slide")
    }
    Slide {
        Text(text = "Second slide")
    }
}
```

### `List`
A **vertical** list which can layout other composables. Horizontal list is currently **not** supported.
```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        List {
            Text(
                text = "ComposePPT is a UI toolkit to create PowerPoint " +
                        "presentations with Compose ðŸ¤©"
            )
            Text(
                text = "ComposePPT uses Compose Runtime under the hood."
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### `Text`
A core text element which can be styled using `TextStyle`.

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        Text(text = "Here is a simple text with default styles")
    }
}
```

You can use `style` parameter to customize the style of a text.

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        Text(
            text = "Here is a text with font size 30 and font color magenta",
            style = TextStyle(
                fontSize = 30f,
                fontColor = Color.MAGENTA
            )
        )
    }
}
```

## Side Effects
Side effects are supported in composePPT and any job will be awaited before the termination of the program. 

### `LaunchedEffect`
Any job started with `LaunchedEffect` inside a composable will be awaited before terminating the program.
It means that you can do long-running tasks.

```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
            delay(1000)
            println("You will see this line and then program will terminate")
        }
    }
}
```

### `SideEffect`
```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    SideEffect { 
        // Will be executed on every recomposition
    }
}
```

### `DisposableEffect`
```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    DisposableEffect(Unit) {
        onDispose {
            // Will be executed before the disposal of the composition 
        }
    }
}
```

## Composition Locals

### `LocalTextStyle`
A composition local for the text style to be used in `Text` composable. You can provide a custom text style using this composition local.

Example:
```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    Slide {
        val smallRedTextStyle = TextStyle(
            fontSize = 10f,
            fontColor = Color.RED
        )

        CompositionLocalProvider(
            LocalTextStyle provides smallRedTextStyle
        ) {
            List {
                Text(
                    text = "This text is using the provided custom text style through " +
                            "LocalTextStyle composition local."
                )
                Text(
                    text = "If you check this and above text element there is no style set " +
                            "but they both have the same style which is different than default."
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## State in ComposePPT
You can use `remember` composable function in the compose runtime inside any of the composePPT composable body.
Any changes made to the state objects will trigger recomposition.

Example: 
```kotlin
runComposePPT {
    var rememberedStateValue by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        delay(1000)
        rememberedStateValue = 1
    }

    DisposableEffect(Unit) {
        onDispose {
            assert(rememberedStateValue == 1) // True
        }
    }
}
```

## Limitations
You can only use `LaunchedEffect` to launch a coroutine. Even though using `rememberCoroutineScope` will work, it will not terminate the program. So you have to manually terminate it in order the presentation file to be created.
